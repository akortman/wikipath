A university project analysing heuristics for graph search within Wikipedia.

This is a data analysis and visualization project I worked on in 2016. It involves analysis of using various heuristics as part of a heuristic graph search across the graph of Wikipedia: Wikipedia articles are the graph vertices, and links within an article to another article are a (one-way) edge in the graph.
